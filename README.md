# Advance-Image-Processing-using-ML
Tasks Implemented :-
*Only numpy is allowed to process the task*
1) Read the image and convert it to grayscale. Display both the images.
2) Using Sobel operator, perform edge detection on the grayscale image. Display the resultant
image. 
3) Add Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 5 to the grayscale image. Perform denoising
using Median and Gaussian filtering (standard deviation of 4). Compute Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio (package allowed for PSNRs) of the filtered images with respect to the original image.
4) Perform histogram equalization on the original grayscale image and perform the Otsu
thresholding operation. Display both the images. 
5) Perform morphological operations dilation, erosion, closing and opening. Display each image
after operation.
